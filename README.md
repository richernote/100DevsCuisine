# 100DevsCuisine

This is my rendition of the cuisine site for 100devs. I decided to do a coffee shop spin on it.

The intent is to do a mobile first design, changing the style as the screen size grows.

### TODO
    - finish carosel implimentation
    - adjsut for tablet, laptop, and desktop screen sizes
    - direct links in navigation/buttons on page
    - finish footer
    - expand menu; maybe add a carousel like feature to swap out different menus for lunch, breakfast etc.
    - customer reviews?
